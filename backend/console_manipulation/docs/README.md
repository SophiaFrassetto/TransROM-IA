# ðŸ“š Console Manipulation Documentation

> :brazil: [VersÃ£o em PortuguÃªs](README_PT.md)

This folder contains technical documentation, guides, and references for the ROM manipulation and console-specific modules of the TransROM-IA project.

## Purpose
- Centralize all technical docs related to ROM analysis, extraction, translation, and manipulation.
- Provide reference material for each supported console (starting with GBA).
- Serve as a knowledge base for contributors and future development.

## How to Use
- Read the documentation before implementing or extending any console manipulation features.
- Use the guides and references to understand memory maps, pointer structures, compression, and other technical details.
- Contribute improvements or new docs as you expand support for more consoles.

## Main Documentation Files
- [GBA.md](GBA.md) â€” Game Boy Advance technical and reverse engineering guide (English)

Feel free to add new documentation files for other consoles or topics as the project evolves.
